================================ Spring Social ===============================
Spring Social is an extension of the Spring Framework that helps you connect your
applications with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers such as Facebook and Twitter.

To get up and running quickly using the project, see the Quickstart:
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social/wiki/Quick-Start

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get the code and build from source, do the following:

git clone --recursive git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social.git
cd spring-social
./gradlew build

Note: the --recursive switch above is important, as spring-social uses
git submodules, which must themselves be cloned and initialized. If --recursive
is omitted, doing so becomes a multi-step process of: 

git clone git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social.git
git submodule init
git submodule update

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate Eclipse metadata (.classpath and .project files), do the following:

./gradlew eclipse

Once complete, you may then import the projects into Eclipse:
File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate IDEA metadata (.iml and .ipr files), do the following:

./gradlew idea

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the JavaDoc, do the following from within the root directory:

 ./gradlew :docs:api

The result will be available in 'docs/build/api'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that the core Spring Social project no longer contains provider modules.
Each of the provider modules is now in its own project.
This will enable those modules to progress and release on a separate schedule
than Spring Social and be able to react more quickly to changes in the provider's
API without the need to wait for a Spring Social release.

The SaaS provider-specific projects can be cloned from the following GitHub URLs:

Twitter: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-twitter.git
Facebook: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-facebook.git
LinkedIn: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-linkedin.git
TripIt: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-tripit.git
GitHub: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-github.git
Gowalla: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-gowalla.git

Each of these projects uses the same build submodule as Spring Social. Thus,
you'll need to either clone them with the --recursive switch or init/update the
submodule as described above from Spring Social.
